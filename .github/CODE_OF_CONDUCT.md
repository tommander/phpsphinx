# Code of Conduct

Although the humankind successfully advanced to the 21st century more than two decades ago, it is important to remind ourselves that bad behaviour and habits that Bible warns us from still exist 2000 years later. And some other forms have appeared in the meantime.

That is one of the reasons why we created this Code of Conduct to make sure that the whole community of this project can cooperate in a safe, peaceful, open and inclusive environment.

## What is our goal

Our goal is to work on the project PhpSphinx - to fix errors, issues and mistakes, improve its functionality, make it accessible, open and useful.

## How to achieve the goal

By building an open, inclusive and welcoming community, where everyone is safe from bad behaviour, prejudice and harassment of any kind.

By sharing our know-how, skills, experience, time, ideas and opinions.

## How can I contribute

- Respect each other's religion and belief
- Be kind, open and patient
- Listen to others and give them space to express their ideas and opinions
- Be ready to find compromises and to be constructive in discussions
- Speak up if anything is not OK
- We are all people and make mistakes; be ready apologize and forgive

## No-no

- Don't break the law
- Don't make yourself superior over others
- Don't accept or perform harassment and bad behaviour
- Don't ridicule or insult others
- Don't get involved and don't start or make worse a discussion that leads to a violation of this Code
- Don't write or post anything that can't be safely read or viewed by children
- Don't tell others things you wouldn't tell them in person
- Don't use this community for discussions and actions that are not contributing to our goal

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is targeting the interaction between members of the community (e.g. written communication) or interaction of the member of the community with other people.

It includes e.g. e-mail communication (incl. mailing lists), social media interaction, discussions on GitHub, in the code, on forums or face-to-face events.

The rules regarding coding standards, use of technology, contribution standards via Issues or Pull Requests (excl. discussions within) is not covered by this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement of our rules

We are humans. Nobody is perfect. That's why everyone can do a mistake and we understand that.

So, generally, you don't have to be worried that for every little mistake you will be put on the *Wall of Shame* and everyone will be pointing fingers at you for the rest of you life.

If you know you made some mistake, make sure to learn from it and to acknowledge that. Fix it and mitigate the effects on your own or request a help from the community. An apology to the community and/or people affected goes a long way, too.

If you don't know, the community leaders have the responsibility to act accordingly to make sure this Code of Conduct is enforced and can contribute to a healthy community.

## Reporting and point of contact

If you notice a violation of this Code of Conduct or if you feel it is necessary to change or adjust this Code, please send an e-mail to [tomas.rajnoha@proton.me](mailto:tomas.rajnoha@proton.me) or contact [tommander@GitHub](https://github.com/tommander). We will stay in touch to let you know, what exactly is being done regarding the violation you reported.

Also, at any time, feel free to discuss if you feel that there was no violation, that there is a reason why it must have been done etc.

Please be aware that interaction on internet **is** subject to rules defined by laws and as such might need to be reported to respective authorities.

### 1. Private warning

In case of a minor violation of this Code of Conduct, expect a private warning explaining how the Code of Conduct was violated, why that is not acceptable and what steps are expected from you.

### 2. Public warning

In case of violations of this Code of Conduct without sufficient mitigation steps or acknowledgement of such violation (incl. repeated violations), the warning may be done publicly and you may be asked to refrain from some interaction with the community or some members of it for a limited time. Why it is not acceptable and what steps are expected from you will be part of that warning as well as why the warning is made public.

### 3. Temporary ban

Major violations or repeated misbehaviour may result in a temporary ban from interaction with the community, incl. (but not limited to) limited access to interaction with the source code.

It is still expected that you acknowledge what you have done, apologize publicly to the community and/or the people affected and conduct necessary steps to fix and mitigate the effects of the violation.

### 4. Permanent ban

As a last resort, we reserve our right to use a permanent ban from interaction with the community for those, who have violated the Code of Conduct in a serious way (repeatedly or not) and do not perform any steps to acknowledge and to change their behaviour.

Remember, a permanent ban is permanent. We are all aware of the fact that we should forgive, that judging is not our right and that everyone can change, but as mentioned, this is a last resort that is meant to protect this community and its members and as such, we need a tool like this. We do hope we never have to use it. And that is up to you all.
