# Contributing

Firstly, a big thank you for your decision to contribute or even for considering it! This project grows significantly with every contributor adding their know-how, experiences, ideas and opinions to it.

## Ways of Contributing

You do not have to be a developer to be able to contribute to this project! Although we welcome developers to work on the code, there is plenty of other tasks that need to be done, so that the idea of the project can be delivered to those who can benefit from it.

Here is just a short (not final) list of help needed:

- **Translation** - not everyone speaks English after all.
- **Frontend** - if the user interface and experience works against users, the functionality of the app can be whatever it wants to be, but nobody will use it.
- **Backend** - all the function and flow of the app has to be supported by a good quality code that performs fast while it knows how to handle exceptions and errors.
- **Testing** - best tests are often conducted by users, who might use the app in ways totally unforeseen, but with good testers, we may catch a lot of errors before they reach users.
- **Documentation** - users, contributors, auditors and many other people rely on the documentation to give them quickly all the important information they need.
- **Security** - we don't want users as well as us to be put in danger by security flaws, do we?

## Level of Skills

Are you a beginner who would like to learn more on a real-life project? An advanced person who is looking for challenges? An expert who would like to put their expertise to a good use? Anybody can contribute!

If you're not sure how exactly or what to grab, just consult any of the maintainers and we will find a way. Do not worry to reach us out with any question.

## How to start

First check the project and what is happening around it. You can start with the [README.md](https://github.com/tommander/phpsphinx/blob/main/README.md), with the [Documentation](https://tommander.github.io/phpsphinx/) and [Issues](https://github.com/tommander/phpsphinx/issues). Also check the [Code of Conduct]() and if needed anytime, feel free to get some [Support]().

Then it might be a good idea to think about how you want to contribute.

Do you already have an idea, how exactly do you want to contribute? Then check the Issues to ensure nobody is working on the same thing. Sure you can join them if they agree or discuss with them; they might get some further ideas and opinions on their task and you may learn from their position. For the same reason, please create an Issue before you start your work; as mentioned, you might get some additional insights and ideas and even people to help you with your task.

If you still look around for a way to contribute, check the Issues for unassigned ones. If you need, you can propose, how you are going to do your contribution and the community can help to shape the final way, so that you don't spend too much time doing things that will eventually need rework.

## Issue

Some basic information on [Issues @GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).

Currently you can choose from Bug report of Feature request templates that will help you to fill in the important information.

## Pull request

I recommend starting with [Creating a pull request @GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), because there you can most probably find all the information you need. If not, let us know.
