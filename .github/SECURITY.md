# Security

This project is developed and maintained by people, so it's understood that some mistake can happen. Also, this project relies on the code of other libraries and software, for which a security incident can be found anytime.

That is why we are *very thankful* to anyone who is reporting security issues to us, because we might not notice on our own or by using our existing tools and sources.

Important note on this: please keep your findings private and don't disclose them to anyone until the fix is available. Of course, if disclosure is required by law (e.g. when personally identifiable information was stolen) or by other important circumstances, we can't do much about it. But keeping it private whenever possible until it is fixed helps keep the security of our users and our community and gives us time to fix and test such issues properly.

For convenience, here's what an ideal process of a security issue report could look like:

1. **Contact** - please write an e-mail to [tomas.rajnoha@proton.me](mailto:tomas.rajnoha@proton.me) with all the necessary and detailed information on your findings.
2. **Acknowledgement** - within ~24 hours you will be informed back via e-mail that your report was received and is being reviewed.
3. **Assessment** - within another ~48 hours you will be informed again whether your report is indeed considered a security threat. If not, we may ask you to publish your report as a normal bug report in [Issues @GitHub](https://github.com/tommander/phpsphinx/issues).
4. **Fixing** - we will be "quietly" working on patching the vulnerability that was reported by you and staying in touch
5. **Disclosure** - at this time, the patch will be published along with your report and all other necessary information.

The above mentioned e-mail address is your point of contact in case you have some additional questions or requests.

Thank you again!
